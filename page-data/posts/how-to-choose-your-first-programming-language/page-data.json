So, don’t go on searching for the best programming language.</li>\n<li>Choose a language that has good online support.</li>\n<li>Choose a language that is not scary and easy to write code in. </li>\n<li>My personal preference is <code class=\"language-text\">python</code>. Although, javascript is also a good option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since you have come so far, I know that you have the patience and the interest\nto read the entire story. I tried my best to shorten the story, but the I needed\nto convince you of a very important step - choosing your first programming\nlanguage.</p>\n<p>People who want to start writing code, or students who want to build their\ncareer as software developers often think which programming language they should\nstart with. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some want to choose the best programming language. </li>\n<li>Some want a language that is famous in the industry and can help them get good jobs.</li>\n<li>Some want to learn the newest language in the market. It must be better than the old ones.</li>\n<li>Some go after building apps, and think they will learn the language on the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Programming language is a tool. It doesn’t make you a better developer, and\nwill not give you better credibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So….. which language should you start with ???</p>\n<p>That depends on what you want to achieve after learning the language.</p>\n<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to build an Android app learn Kotlin or Java.</li>\n<li>If you want to build an iOS app learn Swift.</li>\n<li>If you want to build beautiful web pages learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>\n<li>If you are a student and want good grades in your language course, learn whatever the professor is teaching you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BUT … if you want to build a good career as a software engineer …</p>\n<p>DO NOT go after searching for the best programming languages, learn how to build\nlogical solutions to a problem.</p>\n<p>What do I mean by that?</p>\n<p>Programming languages are just tools that help humans ask computers to do stuff\nfor them. Each programming language just makes it easier to do a certain kind of\njob or in some cases it is the only tool we can choose.</p>\n<p>For example, the browser(Chrome, Firefox etc.) understands only HTML, CSS and\nJavascript. You can’t write a program in C++ or Java that has to be executed on\nthe browser. An Android application needs to be written in Kotlin or Java only.</p>\n<p>Software developers are paid to build solutions to problems. To build efficient\nand stable solutions, one would eventually have to work on multiple languages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The real deal lies in using the best tool to solve the problem at hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tools(language or frameworks) that you will use to build a chat application(like WhatsApp) will be completely different from the tools to be used to build a photo sharing site like Instagram.</p>\n<p>Every programming language(or framework) has its strengths and weaknesses. They must be chosen based on the end result needed.</p>\n<p><em>The real question is - What knowledge should I have to easily switch between\nmultiple languages or frameworks.</em></p>\n<p>Every language has more or less similar constructs and tools to get things done. Some common constructs are -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Variables</li>\n<li>Arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc.</li>\n<li>Conditional statements - If a condition is true perform some action.</li>\n<li>Looping constructs - Repeat a task certain number of times.</li>\n<li>Object Oriented Programming - A certain pattern of writing code</li>\n<li>Functional Programming - Another pattern of writing code</li>\n<li>Error handling</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Understand these basics. Learn where and how to use them. If you are comfortable\nusing these patterns in one language, you can use them in other languages also.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn one language first. Learn it well. Be very comfortable in that language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You don’t want to be this guy  -</p>\n<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prd-hc-oj-public-1/public/users/73794b05-fe63-4188-81cd-b6fd35c7aa4e/images/IkJbqBowiMTx5K7gp1gUbkAOMseLi019\">\n<p><em>(Source: <a href=\"http://geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2009/7/25/the-art-of-programming-part-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2009/7/25/the-art-of-programming-part-2.html</a>)</em></p>\n<p>Coming to the million dollar question of What Should My First Programming Language?</p>\n<p>Your first programming language show should be -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should be simple to write in, so that you can concentrate on the solution rather than the language syntax.</li>\n<li>Should be easier to find help on the internet. Common problems have been addressed in online forums like StackOverflow etc.</li>\n<li>Should have an ecosystem of stable libraries for common tasks like building web services, parsing files of common formats(json etc.).</li>\n<li>Better if it is popular in the software industry. Eg. a language called ‘Javascript’ is very famous, but a language like ‘Lisp’ is not so famous. Working on an industry famous language adds weight to your resume.</li>\n<li>Since, it is very common for developers to work on web services. Your first language should have a good support building web applications.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>I would recommend to choose amongst following two languages that satisfy the\nabove criteria -</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Python</strong> <img width=\"200\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prd-hc-oj-public-1/public/users/73794b05-fe63-4188-81cd-b6fd35c7aa4e/images/8r2wVkA4W3qIUR4FGDe3Tr5dZI97zbrw\"></li>\n<li><strong>Javascript</strong> <img width=\"80\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prd-hc-oj-public-1/public/users/73794b05-fe63-4188-81cd-b6fd35c7aa4e/images/szKckFUtCsH2kWNTHSIQkJJQXVDPxTyA\"></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Both are pretty easy to learn and write code in. </li>\n<li>Both have very good online support i.e. you can find answers to almost all the problems you will face while working in them.</li>\n<li>Both have a stable ecosystem of libraries. This is very important for any language.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Python and Javascript both do not scare beginner developers.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-programming-language","tagSlugs":["/tag/programming/","/tag/python/","/tag/javascript/","/tag/beginner/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-01-02","description":"The articles helps to decide your first programming language.","tags":["programming","python","javascript","beginner"],"title":"How to choose your First Programming Language","socialImage":"/media/gutenberg.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-programming-language"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
