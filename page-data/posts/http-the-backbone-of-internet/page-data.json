We\ncan’t imagine our lives without the ease and information the internet provides\nus.

It goes without saying that there\nis great business opportunity for companies and people making online\napplications. </p>\n<p>Those who are in the business of building online applications/services, or\nintend to join such as business should have an understanding of the units that\nforms the internet as we know it today.

That content has to be\ntransferred from the remote computers to your mobile or laptop. There are\nmillions and billions of users consuming information on their computers. To\nreliably serve so many consumers there is need of certain rules(also called\n‘protocols’) to transfer the data from the storage computers to the consumers.\n<em>HTTP</em> is one of those rules. And it is a very important rule. Almost everything\n<a href=\"that\">that</a> you see in our web browser or mobile uses HTTP!</p>\n<p>HTTP is an acronym that stands for <em><em>H</em>yper<em>T</em>ext <em>T</em>ransfer <em>P</em>rotocol</em>.</p>\n<p><em>HTTP is a set of rules that specifies how two computers can talk to each other\nover the internet.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"who-made-http-and-where-is-it-written-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-made-http-and-where-is-it-written-\" aria-label=\"who made http and where is it written  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who made HTTP and where is it written ?</h2>\n<p>The first version of HTTP is called <em>HTTP 0.9</em> and was developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tim\nBerners-Lee</a> in 1989. </p>\n<p><img width=\"200\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prd-hc-oj-public-1/public/users/73794b05-fe63-4188-81cd-b6fd35c7aa4e/images/XAdOpEwgnPiHryCJ1hcUBYjTCfXcebP6\" style=\"display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\"></p>\n<p>(Image Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n<p>Tim is an engineer and computer scientist.

Hence, multiple versions needs to be developed, where each version\nis better than the previous one. HTTP also has multiple versions. <em>The most\ncommonly used version is HTTP 1.1.</em></p>\n<p>The latest version for HTTP 1.1 is mention in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">RFC 7230</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"if-i-want-to-learn-developing-online-apps-do-i-need-to-know-everything-http-documentation-says\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#if-i-want-to-learn-developing-online-apps-do-i-need-to-know-everything-http-documentation-says\" aria-label=\"if i want to learn developing online apps do i need to know everything http documentation says permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>If I want to learn developing online apps, do I need to know everything HTTP documentation says?</h2>\n<p>Fortunately no. </p>\n<p>The exact rules are implemented by the browser. Each browser is developed and\nenhanced by their respective team of developers. The team should ensure that\ntheir browser software is up to date with the HTTP protocols and the continuous\nenhancements being made in it.</p>\n<p>As a software developer, one must know the basics of HTTP i.e. the principles\non which it is designed.

Is it the plural of HTTP?</h2>\n<p><em>HTTPS</em> is another protocol. <em>HTTPS</em> stands for <em>HTTP Secure</em> which, as the name\nsuggests, is HTTP with enhanced security. HTTPS ensures that the data that is\nbeing transferred from one computer to another is *encrypted so that bad guys\ncan’t read your data.</p>\n<p>*<strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of transforming data into some garbage values so\nthat people can’t make sense from it. The sender computer encrypts and sends\nthe data to the receiver, and only the receiver has the knowledge to transform\nthe data into its original form. Hence, even if a third person possesses the\nencrypted data, he/she can’t understand it.</p>\n<p>Without HTTPS services like internet banking, chatting applications(like\nWhatsApp), Instagram etc. can’t function!</p>\n<p>HTTPS is mandatory for online security. You must not trust websites that do not\noperate on HTTPS. Anyone can read your data in non HTTPS websites.</p>\n<p>Browser can show visual signs about a <em>secured site</em> running on HTTPS vs an\nunsecured site running on plain HTTP.
